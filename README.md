A Snakemake workflow for Short Variant Discovery in Host Genomes


## Usage

- Test that it works:
  - Make sure you have installed snakemake, samtools and bcftools. Either
    - install them with conda/mamba :`conda install -c bioconda samtools bcftools`).
    - or create an environment (`conda create -n 3dohg -c bioconda snakemake samtools bcftools`), and activate it (`conda activate 3dohg`)
  - Generate mock data with `bash workflow/scripts/generate_mock_data.sh`
  - Run the pipeline: `snakemake --use-conda --jobs 8 all`. It will download all the necesary software through conda. It should take less than 5 minutes.

- Run it with your own data:
  - Edit `config/samples.tsv` and add your samples and where are they located.
  - Edit `config/features.tsv` with information regarding the reference you are using.
  - Run the pipeline: `snakemake --use-conda --jobs 8 all`.
  - (slurm users): `./run_slurm`
